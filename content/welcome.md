VIS 2020 will be the yearâ€™s premier forum for advances in theory, methods, and applications of visualization and visual analytics. The conference will convene an international community of researchers and practitioners from universities, government, and industry to exchange recent findings on the design and use of visualization tools.

We invite you to share your research, insights, and enthusiasm at IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST), IEEE Information Visualization (InfoVis), and IEEE Scientific Visualization (SciVis). The 2020 program will also feature a diverse range of symposia and associated events, including Visualization in Practice, Visualization in Data Science, the VIS Arts Program, and data analysis Challenge competitions, as well as an Application Spotlights track.
